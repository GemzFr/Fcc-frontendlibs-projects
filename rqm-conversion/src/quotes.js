    text: "I think all the music that I've ever heard continually feeds into what I do â€“ I think this is probably true of everyone. I often find the most original things even the best people are doing are the new ways they find of combining and reinterpreting their influences and pre-existing ideas. That's why it's easy to trace the gradual evolution of music over time, the roots and progressions of different styles."

    text: "In some ways it is a dream to make a living from the music but at the same time I think it is good that we live as normal lives as possible. I think it is a lot more interesting to hear the stories of someone in the same situation as me. It keeps the music as true as possible. Not making a living off this also leaves us great freedom, as we can make whatever we want without worrying about how commercially viable the music is."
